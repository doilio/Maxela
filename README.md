# MaxelaðŸŒ¦
ðŸŒ¦Maxela(Weather in my local dialect - Changana) Is an app that displays weather data in 10 European cities and in my local city Maputo


The App Makes a request to OpenWeatherMap's [API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to get:
  
- A list of the current [`weather data`](https://openweathermap.org/current#one)

Base URL = `"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/"`

**PS:** To test this code you will need to:
1. Get an API Key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
2. Create a file on the Utils package with: 
`const val API_KEY = "PLACE YOUR API KEY HERE"`
